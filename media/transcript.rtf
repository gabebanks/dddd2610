\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hi there, so my name is Gabriel Bankhead and here is my 60 second video for the architecture website. In a business setting, this video would be geared towards showing my portfolio and introducing myself to the FIG company, but because this is just an assignment, I have nothing to show architecture related since I am not an architecture student. But at any rate, I also want to apologize for all of my assignments. being late. I have been sick and I wasn't able to do assignments for almost a week and then that really pushed things behind. So I apologize that up until now, all of my\
assignments have been late. It's not normally that way, but I am trying to catch up. It's just happening very slowly. So thank you, Paul, for all of your patience and understanding when going through all of my assignments really late. But by the end of this week, I should be caught up and that\
is the end of my 60 second clip, so thank you.}
