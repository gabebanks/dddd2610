Hi there, so my name is
Gabriel Bankhead and here

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.079
is my 60 second video for
the architecture website.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.349
In a business setting, this
video would be geared towards

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.708
showing my portfolio and
introducing myself to the FIG

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.649
company, but because this is
just an assignment, I have

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.409
nothing to show architecture
related since I am not

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.499
an architecture student.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.708
But at any rate, I also
want to apologize for all of

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.799
my assignments being late.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.869
I have been sick and I got,
wasn't able to do assignments

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.409
for almost a week and then
that really pushed things

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.129
behind so I apologize that
up until now all of my

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.399
assignments have been late.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.309
It's not normally that way but
I am trying to catch up it's

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.009
just happening very slowly so
thank you Paul for all of your

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.009
patience and understanding
when going through all of my

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.469
assignments really late but
by the end of this week I

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.079
should be caught up and that

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.519
is the end to my 60
second clip, so thank you.
